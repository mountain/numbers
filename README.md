# NumberX: reinvent the numbers again through RL

Numeral system is one basic symbolic system for humankind. Various study in anthropology and linguistics showed that
the natrual numeral system developed by human are sophisticated and diversed.

In the article [1], the author had given several conditions on a good numeral system.
Here I give a modified version. A numeral system is required
* to be a completely covering under a limit
* not to have any ambiguity or homonymy
* to have few or no redundancy (considering the problem of 1 = 0.99999...)
* to have a construct method to extend the system further above any limit

The above points showed that a good formal definition of general numeral system is needed,
and Peano system is only one example.

Though we need to develop a formal definition of general numeral system, our perspective is not formal.
We propose a geometrical point of view for human knowledge.

We believe there are optimization processes happened in the invention history of numbers,
so we can reinvent numbers by optimization processes again now by RL.

The meaning of the symbols in a numeral system can be fully explained by some geometrical object which enjoy some minimal measurement.
