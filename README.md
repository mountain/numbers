# NumberX: reinvent the numbers again through RL

Numeral system is one basic symbolic system of our humankind. Various study in anthropology and linguistics showed that
the natrual numeral system developed by human are sophisticated and diversed. Can AI reinvent the numbers again?

In the article [1], the author had given several conditions on a good numeral system.
And here, I give a modified version. A numeral system is required
* to be a completely covering under a limit
* not to have any ambiguity or homonymy
* to have few or no redundancy (considering the problem of 1 = 0.99999...)
* to have a construct method to extend the system further above any limit

The above conditions showed that a good formal definition of general numeral system is needed,
and Peano system is only one example.

Though we need to develop a formal definition of general numeral system, our perspective is not formal based on strings.
We propose a geometrical formal point of view for human knowledge.

We believe the invention history of numbers was driven by some natural optimization processes,
so now we can reinvent numbers again by RL.

The meaning of the symbols in a numeral system can be fully explained by some geometrical object which enjoy some minimal measurements.

FAQ
====

* What is the differences between [deepmind/mathematics_dataset](https://github.com/deepmind/mathematics_dataset) and this project?

[deepmind/mathematics_dataset](https://github.com/deepmind/mathematics_dataset) is a supervised learning task, 
while our gym environments try to define some unsupervised learning task in which the inventiona of numeral symbols and ability of counting is mandatory.
